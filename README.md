Extremely Basic
Adapted by Neilor Tonin, URI  Brazil

Timelimit: 1
Read 2 variables, named A and B and make the sum of these two variables, assigning its result to the variable X. Print X as shown below. Print endline after the result otherwise you will get “Presentation Error”.

Input
The input file will contain 2 integer numbers.

Output
Print the letter X (uppercase) with a blank space before and after the equal signal followed by the value of X, according to the following example.

Obs.: don't forget the endline after all.

X = 19 | X = -6 | X = 8

#2nd Problem:
The formula to calculate the area of a circumference is defined as A = π . R2. Considering to this problem that π = 3.14159:

Calculate the area using the formula given in the problem description.

Input
The input contains a value of floating point (double precision), that is the variable R.

Output
Present the message "A=" followed by the value of the variable, as in the example bellow, with four places after the decimal point. Use all double precision variables. Like all the problems, don't forget to print the end of line after the result, otherwise you will receive "Presentation Error".

Input Samples
2.00 | 100.64 | 150.00
